# Registration of a block

A block is usually registered in both the server and the client using its `block.json` metadata. 

Although technically blocks could be registered only on the client, **registering blocks in both the server and the client is a general recommendation**, as some key features like Dynamic Rendering, Block Hooks or Block style variations won't work properly without a server registration of the block.

## Registering the block in the server

The registration of a block in the server, usually takes place in the main plugin PHP file with the [`register_block_type`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_type/) function called on the [`init` action](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/init/)  

`register_block_type` takes a first parameter to get the metadata of the block that can be provided:
-  with the path to the `block.json` file with the metadata definition for the block
-  with the path to the folder where the `block.json` file is located

Note that if there's a build process involved, the registered `block.json` should be the one in `build` folder.

Registering a block in the server by calling to `register_block_type` with just its first argument is enough in most of the cases.

## Registering the block in the client

The registration of a block in the client (for the Block Editor), usually takes place in the index.js file (or any other file defined in the `editorScript` property of `block.json`) that act as an entry point for the javascript files required for the block.


in the main plugin PHP file with the [`register_block_type`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_type/) function called on the [`init` action](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/init/)  


<div class="callout callout-info">
At its simplest form, a block it is a <code>registerBlockType</code> function call with some parameters passed in JS. 
</div>

You can use the functions documented on this page to register a block with JavaScript only on the client, but the recommended method is to register new block types also with PHP on the server using the `block.json` metadata file. See metadata documentation for complete information
